#  AUTOMATIC EXTENSION OF THE ANNOTATION OF THE SNAPDRAGON GENOME

##  DESCRIPTION 

The [Genome Annotation of the Snapdragon Genome V2.0] (http://bioinfo.sibs.ac.cn/Am/download_v2.php) included Gene Ontology annotations for 20820 out of 37234 genes (56%). Given that almost half of the genes remained unannotated, we have implemented a method for increasing the number of annotated genes in Antirrhinum majus by using as reference the annotations of the genes of Solanum lycopersicum and Arabidopsis thaliana.

Figure 1 describes the bioinformatics process followed, through which an extended annotation of the genome was obtained, with 26109 genes annotated (70% of the genome).
