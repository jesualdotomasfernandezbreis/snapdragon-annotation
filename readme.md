# The Gene Regulation Application Ontology (GRAO)

GRAO is a GREEKC Consortium development which describes knowledge relevant to the domain of gene regulation. GRAO is an upper-level schema that links the parts of the above-described ontologies relevant for gene regulation. GRAO includes specific cellular processes (such as the binding of dbTFs to DNA binding sites) and the elements involved in those processes (dbTFs and other proteins), but those elements should be reused from existing ontologies. The next figure shows the major classes and relationships that are part of GRAO. This shows the use of prefixes such as GO or SO, which means that those terms are reused from the corresponding ontologies.
